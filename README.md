# Welcome to Tiger Pay!

In case you reach this repository, I want you to know that this is a technical test for IoBuilders.

In it I was asked for the following points to take into account:
- Registration
- Login
- Account visualization (wallet) --> Balance and movements
- Money deposit
- Transferring money from user A to user B

In my case I have decided to use only React and Redux tools, so there is no data persistence.
However, I would like to make it clear that this platform is not real, neither the payment processes nor anything you can see has to do with real money. 
Please avoid entering sensitive data as far as possible.

## Users
Although new users can be created, I have left a couple already created so that you can also test the login functionality from the beginning.

## Forms

The forms are handled by Formik, a forms library that allows us to, as they say 'Create forms in react, without the tears'.
For the validation I used the yup library, because I wanted to learn how to use it and this was a good moment.

## Styles

The styles are loosely optimised for non-computer screens, basically due to time constraints. Even with that, if you use panoramic view it will be decent.

## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun doing this, I'm glad I was able to participate in the process and I hope you'll consider my application.
